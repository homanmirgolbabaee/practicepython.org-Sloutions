#Problem 4
#Divisors
#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
#(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

    x += 1
